## 1. Business Overview & Domain Model

### Executive Summary

Modern commerce, logistics, and supply chain integrations require real-time inventory visibility and uncompromising transaction integrity. In high-velocity commercial environments, traditional systems often encounter critical vulnerabilities: overselling limited stock under concurrent demand, inconsistent financial ledgers from uncoordinated deductions, unauthorized ordering outside contractual partner terms, and accidental duplicate billing caused by network retries.

The **Warehouse REST API Platform** solves these operational challenges by providing a robust, highly resilient transaction service designed for seamless integration with client applications, partner portals, and automated enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.

#### Core Value Delivered
- **Atomic Transactional Integrity:** Balances and warehouse inventory are bound within strict, all-or-nothing transactional guarantees. Stock decrements and account debits occur indivisibly, eliminating overselling, negative inventory, balance overdrafts, and phantom orders under peak concurrency.
- **Contract-Governed Catalog Whitelisting:** Administrators can dynamically enforce account-level brand and category permissions. Clients only discover and purchase products they are legally contracted to acquire, preventing compliance disputes and unauthorized order processing.
- **Idempotent Commercial Execution:** Purchase submissions and financial adjustments support idempotency tokens. Network retries, client timeouts, or connection disconnects safely return the original transaction confirmation without duplicate deductions or split orders.
- **Auditable Financial Precision:** All financial calculations (account balances, unit prices, transaction totals) are managed with exact-cent precision, eliminating floating-point rounding drift across corporate ledgers while maintaining immutable historical price snapshots on every completed transaction.

### Target Users & Business Use Cases

The platform serves two primary commercial personas within an enterprise warehouse ecosystem:

| Persona | Business Role & Objectives | Key Responsibilities & Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Warehouse Administrator** | Operational Overseer & System Governance | • Onboard new client accounts and govern organizational credentials.<br>• Credit customer balances upon invoice settlement or adjust credit ceilings.<br>• Configure category and manufacturer whitelists aligned with partner contracts.<br>• Register catalog items, manage inventory, and oversee fulfillment lifecycles. |
| **Purchasing Client** | Commercial Partner & Authorized Buyer | • Authenticate securely through commercial role channels.<br>• Explore permitted warehouse products with real-time stock availability.<br>• Monitor active purchasing credit and available operational balances.<br>• Submit binding purchase orders with automated idempotency safeguards.<br>• Inspect transaction history and track fulfillment status through delivery. |

#### Core Business Use Cases
1. **Contract-Governed Catalog Browsing:** A purchasing client explores warehouse stock. The system dynamically filters the catalog based on contractual permissions, presenting only authorized product lines and hiding restricted inventory.
2. **Atomic Inventory Ordering:** A client places an order for multiple units of high-demand items. The platform atomically validates product permissions, confirms available warehouse stock, checks credit adequacy, reserves inventory, and settles payment in a single indivisible transaction.
3. **Operational Credit Management:** Following receipt of a wire transfer or commercial invoice payment, an operations administrator credits the customer's balance via an incremental top-up, immediately unlocking purchasing capacity.
4. **Fulfillment Tracking & Reconciliation:** Operations teams progress orders from warehouse packing through carrier dispatch and delivery, providing end-to-end status visibility for customer operations and financial audits.

### Conceptual Entity Relationship Diagram

The conceptual domain model focuses on core business entities, their commercial relationships, and primary domain attributes, abstracting away low-level database mechanics:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ ORDER : "places"
    PRODUCT ||--o{ ORDER : "fulfills"

    USER {
        string accountName "Commercial organization or user identity"
        string role "System role: Admin or Client"
        string accessLevel "Catalog permission tier: All, Filtered, or None"
        boolean catalogEnabled "Catalog browsing permission toggle"
        decimal balance "Available purchasing credit"
        list allowedCategories "Whitelisted product categories"
        list allowedManufacturers "Whitelisted brand manufacturers"
        string status "Account status: Active or Deactivated"
    }

    PRODUCT {
        string sku "Unique product catalog SKU"
        string category "Product classification (e.g., Electronics, Hardware)"
        string manufacturer "Brand or manufacturer (e.g., Apple, Dell)"
        string model "Commercial product model name"
        decimal unitPrice "Current catalog unit price"
        integer availableStock "Current warehouse units in stock"
    }

    ORDER {
        string orderNumber "Unique commercial purchase reference"
        string productModel "Snapshot model name at time of purchase"
        decimal snapshotUnitPrice "Agreed unit price at time of purchase"
        integer quantity "Number of units acquired"
        decimal totalAmount "Settled order total amount"
        string fulfillmentStatus "Lifecycle state: Created, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, or Cancelled"
        string idempotencyReference "Unique client-supplied idempotency key"
    }
```

#### Core Business Entities
- **User / Customer:** Represents an authenticated commercial account possessing an operational balance, an access tier (`All`, `Filtered`, or `None`), and category/brand whitelist rules governing which products may be viewed or purchased.
- **Product:** Represents warehouse merchandise available for order placement, categorized by industry type, manufacturer brand, and unit cost.
- **Order:** Represents a legally binding transaction between a customer and the warehouse, capturing quantity, settled total amount, and immutable historical price/model snapshots.
- **Financial Precision Standard:** All financial amounts (balances, prices, settlement totals) are calculated and reconciled to the exact cent, eliminating rounding discrepancies between customer receipts and internal accounting ledgers.

## 2. Integration Scenarios & Business Workflows

### Key User Journeys

#### Journey 1: Commercial Authentication & Account Handshake
1. **Credential Submission:** The client application transmits commercial credentials through the appropriate role channel (Customer or Administrator).
2. **Timing-Safe Identity Verification:** The platform validates identity and role membership using constant-time verification, mitigating user enumeration and side-channel threats.
3. **Session Establishment:** Upon successful verification, the system issues an authenticated commercial session.
4. **Profile & Permission Hydration:** The client retrieves its commercial profile, including current purchasing balance, access permission tier, and approved category/brand whitelists.

#### Journey 2: Permission-Aware Catalog Exploration & Filtering
1. **Catalog Query:** The client application requests the active warehouse inventory, optionally supplying category or manufacturer search filters, sorting preferences, and pagination controls.
2. **Access Governance Evaluation:** The engine applies account-level visibility rules:
   - **Restricted Access (`None` or Disabled):** If the account has catalog access disabled or assigned to `None`, an empty catalog is returned. Any order attempt triggers an immediate policy violation rejection.
   - **Unrestricted Access (`All`):** The client may view all warehouse products matching optional search filters.
   - **Filtered Access (`Filtered`):** Products are matched case-insensitively against the client's whitelisted categories and manufacturers, guaranteeing reliable matching regardless of casing variations.
3. **Catalog Presentation:** The system presents permitted items along with live warehouse stock availability and pagination metadata.

#### Journey 3: Idempotent Atomic Order Placement
1. **Purchase Intent Submission:** The client submits a purchase request specifying target product SKU, desired quantity, and an optional client-generated idempotency key.
2. **Idempotency Check:**
   - If the request is a replay of an existing completed order under the same key, the original confirmation is returned immediately with zero additional deduction.
   - If an operation with the same key is currently executing, duplicate execution is blocked.
3. **Eligibility & Inventory Validation:** The platform verifies product existence, ensures the item is within the client's whitelist, confirms warehouse stock sufficiency, and verifies credit adequacy.
4. **Atomic Settlement:** The service executes balance debit and inventory decrement as a single atomic operation, captures an immutable price/model snapshot, and records the confirmed order.
5. **Outcome Delivery:** An order confirmation receipt containing the transaction reference, purchased units, and remaining balance is returned to the client.

#### Journey 4: Administrative Balance & Fulfillment Governance
1. **Balance Adjustment:** Administrators deposit funds into customer accounts via relative top-ups (e.g., following wire transfers) or set absolute balance limits.
2. **Permission Maintenance:** Administrators update category and brand whitelists as partner agreements expand.
3. **Fulfillment Progress:** Warehouse staff progress orders through operational fulfillment stages from receipt through packing, dispatch, and delivery.

### Entity Lifecycle / State Diagram

Every order progresses through a deterministic lifecycle, transitioning from initial draft intent to final delivery or cancellation:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft : Customer selects product & quantity
    
    Draft --> ValidationPending : Submit purchase request

    state ValidationPending {
        [*] --> VerifyPermissions : Check category & brand whitelists
        VerifyPermissions --> VerifyStock : Whitelist approved
        VerifyStock --> VerifyBalance : Warehouse stock available
        VerifyBalance --> [*] : Balance sufficient
    }

    ValidationPending --> Declined : Rule violation (Restricted item / Stock depleted / Credit shortfall)
    
    ValidationPending --> Committing : All validation rules satisfied
    
    state Committing {
        [*] --> DebitAccount : Deduct total amount from balance
        DebitAccount --> DecrementInventory : Reserve warehouse units
        DecrementInventory --> PersistOrderRecord : Store immutable order & price snapshot
        PersistOrderRecord --> [*]
    }

    Committing --> Confirmed : Atomic ledger commit successful
    Committing --> Failed : System lock conflict or transaction aborted

    Confirmed --> Processing : Order sent to warehouse floor for picking & packing
    Processing --> Shipped : Consigned to logistics carrier with tracking reference
    Shipped --> Delivered : Customer receipt verified & order completed
    
    Confirmed --> Cancelled : Administrative reversal (Restores balance & inventory)
    Processing --> Cancelled : Operational cancellation prior to dispatch

    Declined --> [*]
    Failed --> [*]
    Delivered --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

#### Lifecycle State Definitions
- **`Draft`**: The customer is preparing the purchase intent locally prior to submission.
- **`ValidationPending`**: The platform is validating commercial eligibility, whitelist rules, real-time warehouse inventory, and account balance.
- **`Declined`**: A business rule was breached (item restricted by contract, insufficient stock, or balance shortage). No funds or inventory are altered.
- **`Committing`**: The system is executing an atomic database lock, updating customer balance, and decreasing inventory units.
- **`Confirmed`**: The transaction is committed and bound to the commercial ledger. An immutable price and product snapshot is recorded.
- **`Processing`**: Warehouse staff are picking, packing, and preparing items for dispatch.
- **`Shipped`**: The order has been transferred to a carrier for transport.
- **`Delivered`**: Goods have arrived at the customer destination, successfully completing the commercial order.
- **`Cancelled`**: An administrator has annulled the order prior to delivery, releasing stock back to the catalog and refunding the customer balance.

### Business Outcomes & Exception Handling

Integrators can design predictable recovery workflows and client user interfaces based on clear domain-level outcomes:

| Business Condition | Trigger & Cause | System Behavior | Client Integrator Guidance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Order Confirmation** | Client balance $\ge$ total cost, stock $\ge$ quantity, and product allowed by whitelist. | Balance debited, stock decremented, immutable price snapshot recorded, and confirmation issued. | Display order receipt, update account balance badge, and offer shipment tracking. |
| **Catalog Policy Restriction** | Client attempts to order an item outside contractual category/brand whitelists, or catalog access is disabled. | Operation declined immediately without resource locks or state mutation. | Inform client of commercial agreement boundaries; prompt client to request whitelist updates from administrators. |
| **Insufficient Warehouse Stock** | Requested units exceed currently available inventory for the target SKU. | Operation declined without state modification. Balance remains untouched. | Inform user of available stock; offer partial quantity purchase or notify upon restock. |
| **Insufficient Account Balance** | Total purchase amount exceeds available purchasing balance. | Operation declined without state modification. Inventory remains untouched. | Prompt client to top up balance or request credit limit adjustment from administrator. |
| **Duplicate Action (Idempotency Replay)** | Re-transmitting an order with a previously processed idempotency key. | System recognizes previous completion and returns original confirmation without re-executing deduction. | Treat as successful completion; display original receipt and update client interface seamlessly. |
| **Concurrent Action Conflict** | Simultaneous submission of identical operations with the same idempotency key. | In-flight collision is detected; subsequent concurrent request is safely rejected to prevent race conditions. | Advise client to await completion of in-flight operation before retrying. |
| **Entity Not Found** | Target SKU, order reference, or account identifier does not exist or was archived. | Request rejected without data mutation. | Refresh client catalog cache and verify entity identifiers before resubmitting. |
| **Input Boundary Violation** | Submitting non-positive quantity, negative balance, or malformed identifiers. | Request rejected at input boundary before touching database or acquiring locks. | Ensure client form validation enforces non-negative inputs and valid identifier formats. |
| **Channel Privilege Rejection** | Missing valid session credentials or attempting administrative functions with client credentials. | Request rejected at security boundary. | Direct client to commercial login portal or check organizational role privileges. |
| **System Disruption / Maintenance** | Temporary infrastructure unavailability, maintenance window, or unhandled system fault. | Transaction safely aborted and rolled back. Ledger integrity preserved with zero side effects. | Implement exponential backoff retry policy; include request correlation reference if reporting issue. |
